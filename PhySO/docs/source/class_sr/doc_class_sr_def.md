## About Class SR

Class Symbolic Regression (Class SR) is a method for automatically finding a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters.
This hierarchical framework leverages the common constraint that all the members of a single class of physical phenomena follow a common governing law.
