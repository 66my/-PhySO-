## Exploiting multiple datasets

`physo` can exploit multiple datasets by searching for a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters.
We dub this framework (introduced in [[Tenachi 2024]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01816)) "Class Symbolic Regression" (Class SR).

See the Class SR [documentation](https://physo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r_class_sr.html).
